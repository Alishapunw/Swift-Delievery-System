Swift Delivery System

Team Name: CodeKnights

The software offers a wide range of benefits to businesses dealing with pickup and delivery, 
appointment and field force management. It bridges the gap between the Owner (Manager), 
Customers and Delivery agents with real time accurate tracking and updated notifications for every status of task.

Overview Of The System:

    The system will accept the endpoint locations from Manager (Sender).
    Considering the endpoint locations, the system will locate its nearest delivery offices to carry out the deliveries.
    Accepting these nodes, the system will generate an efficient path or route - considering factors like distance and time.
    The users will also be able to track the position of the package from pickup to delivery.
